It Started at a Run Club

Hi, I am Travis.

I moved to West Hollywood in 2024 and joined a run club because I was looking for people. Community. Fun. A reason to show up.

That first run with West Hollywood Run Club was phenomenal.
Not because of pace or performance, but because of the energy. No pressure. No egos. Just people showing up, moving their bodies, laughing, sweating, and genuinely enjoying being there.

What I loved most was how simple it felt. Everyone belonged. All paces were welcome. Some days you push it. Some days you take it easy. Most of the time, you are out there because it feels good to move together.

That mattered to me.

Outside the runs, I started to notice how scattered everything felt. People shared moments on Instagram. Conversations lived in group texts. Workouts were tracked in different apps. But there was no single place to actually belong. No space that brought it all together, whether you were moving with others or doing your own thing.

I run. I train. I work out.
But fitness is not just part of my life. It is something I share.

That became even more clear through my sister, Ashley. She is disabled and new here, and helping her stay active has been one of the most meaningful parts of my life. Since moving here, she walks more, takes fitness classes, and genuinely loves seeing her progress. Counting her miles. Feeling proud of what her body can do. Being part of something.

She deserves a place in fitness. So do people like her.

As I looked closer, the gap was everywhere.

Run club leaders had no real tools to support their communities. Creators had audiences, but no true home. Pros were incredible, but hard to discover unless you already knew where to look. And everyday people, at every pace and ability, were left stitching things together on their own.

Everything felt scattered.

That gap became CLUCK.

Not just another app or leaderboard.
CLUCK is a place where community actually lives, where progress is celebrated, and where everyone has a place to belong.

Dmitri and I created CLUCK together.

He brings the technology and the systems thinking. The brain.
I bring the community, the heartbeat, and the lived experience of being out there. Running, training, and building this alongside the people it is for.

Together, we believed fitness deserved something more human.

“Not just another app or leaderboard. CLUCK is a place where community actually lives, and where everyone can be part of it.”
