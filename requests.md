This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Services, including website visitors, registered users, and mobile application users.

Acceptance and Scope

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.

By accessing, installing, registering for, or using any part of the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, as well as our Terms of Use available at https://clucklabs.com/terms (the “Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference.

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or the Terms, you must not access or use the Services.

This Privacy Policy governs only information collected by Cluck through the Services and does not apply to information collected by third parties, including through third-party applications, websites, devices, platforms, or services that may integrate with or be accessible through the Services.
Nature of the Services; No Medical Relationship

Cluck provides fitness, wellness, educational, organizational, and lifestyle-oriented tools, including optional AI-powered insights and goal-oriented features. Cluck is not a medical provider, does not provide medical services, and does not establish a doctor-patient or other healthcare relationship.

General Data Processing Principles

Without limiting any other provision of this Privacy Policy:
We collect and process information only to the extent reasonably necessary to operate, maintain, secure, improve, and support the Services.
We may process information for internal analytics, debugging, security, compliance, and legal purposes.
We reserve the right to retain information as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.


Third-Party Health Information

At your direction and only with your explicit permission, the Services may connect to certain third-party applications, devices, platforms, or services (collectively, “Third-Party Applications”), which may include, without limitation, Apple Health, wearable devices, laboratories, testing services, or other third-party data providers.

If you authorize such connections, Cluck may import limited health-, fitness-, activity-, or lifestyle-related data made available by those Third-Party Applications. This data may include, by way of example only: activity metrics, exercise information, heart rate, sleep data, blood oxygen levels, respiratory rate, height, weight, age, or similar measurements. If you authorize connections to laboratory or testing services, imported data may include test results provided by those services.

All data imported from Third-Party Applications is referred to collectively as “Health Information.”Important Disclosures Regarding Third-Party Health Information
Cluck does not create, verify, endorse, validate, or control Health Information provided by Third-Party Applications.
Cluck has no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, legality, reliability, or clinical validity of any Health Information.
Health Information is provided “as is” and “as available.”
You acknowledge that Third-Party Applications operate independently from Cluck and are governed by their own terms, privacy policies, permissions, and data practices.
You are solely responsible for reviewing, understanding, and accepting the terms and privacy practices of any Third-Party Application before enabling a connection.
Cluck does not require you to connect any Third-Party Applications to use the Services. Enabling such connections is entirely optional and may be disabled by you at any time through your device, operating system, or the applicable Third-Party Application.

Health Information accessed through Third-Party Applications is used solely to support the functionality of the Services, including optional features you choose to enable. Health Information is not used for advertising or marketing purposes.

Where Your Information Is Stored

Cluck stores and processes personal information using a combination of secure third-party infrastructure providers and, in limited cases, your own device, depending on the type of information and the features you choose to enable.1. Account, Contact, and User-Generated Information

Contact information (such as name and email address), account credentials, and non-biometric user-generated content (including logged activities, workouts, goals, schedules, and similar data) are stored and processed on secure third-party cloud infrastructure so that the Services can function properly, synchronize across devices, and provide continuity of use.2. Health Information

Health Information imported from Third-Party Applications may be stored and processed in different locations depending on the feature:
By default, certain biometric or health-related data is stored and processed locally on your device, subject to the design and permissions of your operating system and connected Third-Party Applications.
Cluck does not routinely access or store biometric Health Information in the cloud unless you explicitly enable features that require cloud processing.
3. Optional Features and AI-Powered Functionality

If you enable optional features—such as Cluck Intelligence—certain limited Health Information or related contextual data may be transmitted to and processed by third-party cloud hosting providers and artificial intelligence technology partners.
Only the minimum information reasonably necessary to generate the requested functionality is transmitted.
Certain categories of sensitive data, including reproductive health information, are excluded by default unless you expressly opt in.
Once transmitted, such data is subject to the technical and organizational safeguards of those third-party providers.

Cluck is based in the United States, and personal information is generally stored and processed in the United States.

By accessing or using the Services, you expressly consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information in the United States or other jurisdictions where Cluck or its service providers operate. You acknowledge that data protection laws in these jurisdictions may differ from those in your country of residence and may not offer the same level of protection.

In certain circumstances, governmental authorities, courts, or regulatory bodies in these jurisdictions may have lawful access to your information.

We may, however, disclose personal information to service providers, partners, affiliates, or other third parties as described in this Privacy Policy and solely for legitimate business purposes, including operating, maintaining, improving, and securing the Services, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

Such disclosures do not constitute a “sale” of personal information under applicable U.S. state privacy laws. Where required by law, we also provide users with the ability to exercise opt-out rights related to certain data processing activities, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.


Third-Party Links and Websites

The Services may contain links to, integrations with, or content from third-party websites, applications, platforms, or services (“Third-Party Services”).

Cluck does not own, operate, control, or endorse any Third-Party Services and is not responsible for their availability, content, functionality, accuracy, security, or privacy practices.

Your access to and use of Third-Party Services is entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of those Third-Party Services. Cluck expressly disclaims any liability arising from your interactions with or reliance on Third-Party Services.

We encourage you to review the applicable terms and privacy policies of any Third-Party Services before engaging with them.Our Content on Third-Party Services

Cluck content, features, or Services may be made available on, embedded within, or integrated with Third-Party Services, or Cluck may otherwise utilize Third-Party Services to host, distribute, promote, or remarket content.

Cluck does not control how Third-Party Services collect, use, or disclose information once you interact with those platforms. Any information you provide or actions you take on Third-Party Services are governed by the applicable third party’s privacy policy and terms—not this Privacy Policy.

Third-Party Services may use cookies, pixels, mobile identifiers, or similar technologies to collect information about your activity across websites and applications for purposes such as analytics, advertising, or remarketing. Cluck is not responsible for such technologies or data practices.

Editing your profile directly through the Services (where available), or
Contacting us at legal@clucklabs.com
We may retain historical or archived versions of information as reasonably necessary for legal, compliance, security, dispute resolution, auditing, or operational purposes, even after updates are made.2. Account Deactivation and Data Retention

You may request deactivation of your account by contacting legal@clucklabs.com. Account deactivation does not automatically result in deletion of all personal information.

We may retain certain information after account deactivation where retention is:
Required or permitted by law
Necessary to enforce agreements
Needed to resolve disputes or investigate misuse
Required for security, fraud prevention, or system integrity
3. Marketing and Promotional Communications

Even if you opt out of marketing communications, we may continue to send non-promotional, transactional, or service-related communications, including account notices, policy updates, and security alerts.4. Cluck Intelligence and AI Features

Use of AI-powered features, including Cluck Intelligence, is optional.
You may choose whether or not to enable or interact with AI Features.
If enabled, certain information you provide or authorize may be processed as described in this Privacy Policy.
Disabling AI Features does not retroactively delete information previously processed, subject to retention limitations and applicable law.
You acknowledge that disabling AI Features may limit certain functionality of the Services.5. Advertising and Interest-Based Ads

Some advertising or analytics content may be delivered by third-party networks that use cookies, pixels, mobile identifiers, or similar technologies.

You may opt out of certain interest-based advertising by visiting:
www.aboutads.info/choices (web browsers)
www.aboutads.info/appchoices (mobile applications)
Opting out does not eliminate advertising entirely and does not prevent the collection of information for non-advertising purposes such as analytics or security.6. Tracking Technologies and Cookies

Most web browsers accept cookies by default. You may configure your browser to remove or reject cookies; however, doing so may limit or prevent certain features of the Services from functioning properly.

On mobile devices, you may limit tracking through your device’s privacy settings. The availability and effectiveness of such controls depend on your device and operating system.7. Location and Analytics Controls

Where Third-Party Services provide controls to limit data collection (such as analytics or location-based services), you may exercise those controls directly through the applicable Third-Party Service or device settings.

Cluck does not guarantee that disabling such controls will eliminate all data collection, particularly where such collection is necessary to operate, secure, or maintain the Services.8. Choosing Not to Provide Information

You may choose not to provide certain personal information. However, doing so may result in limited access to features or the inability to use all or part of the Services.

Cluck is not responsible for any loss of functionality resulting from your decision not to provide information.

Information Security

Cluck implements commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure.

These measures may include, without limitation, access controls, encryption in transit and at rest where appropriate, monitoring, and security reviews. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and Cluck does not guarantee absolute security.

You acknowledge and agree that:
You use the Services at your own risk
Cluck is not responsible for unauthorized access caused by factors beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to cyberattacks, system failures, third-party actions, or force majeure events
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for any activity occurring under your account
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Cluck disclaims liability for any unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure of personal information not resulting from Cluck’s willful misconduct.

Necessary for legitimate business purposes
Required for fraud prevention, security, auditing, or compliance
Deletion requests are subject to technical limitations and legal obligations, and complete or immediate deletion cannot be guaranteed.
